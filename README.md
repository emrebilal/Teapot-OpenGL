# Teapot_OpenGL
Project Goal:

 I created two windows with a teapot using the predefined. The first window reacts on left/right/middle mouse button actions, i.e. pressing the button and moving the mouse will rotate teapot.
 In the second window the left mouse button is not used. There is a menu attached to the right mouse button which gives several different views of the teapot. I used lights and materials for the surface of the teapot.
